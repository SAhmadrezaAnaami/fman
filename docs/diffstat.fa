📖 **Description:**
    The `diffstat` command displays a statistical summary of the changes made to files, based on the output of the `diff` command. It helps you see how many lines were added and removed for each file that has been changed.

⚙️ **Options:**
    🔹 `diffstat -n <width>` --> 🔢 Set the display width to <width>.  If <width> is not given, it uses the terminal width.
    🔹 `diffstat -r`  --> 🔄 Display filenames relative to the root directory.
    🔹 `diffstat -w`  --> ⚠️ Output in the form 'width, name', which is useful for sorting the output with `sort -n`.

🛠 **Examples:**

    $ diff -u file1.txt file2.txt | diffstat

    🔹 Display statistics of changes between two files.

    $ diff -u directory1 directory2 | diffstat -r

    🔹 Display statistics of changes between directories, with filenames relative to the root directory.

✅ **Simple Example:**

    $ diff -u old.txt new.txt | diffstat
    old.txt | 1 + 1 -
    new.txt | 1 + 1 -

    🔹 This shows that both `old.txt` and `new.txt` each have one line added and one line removed.
