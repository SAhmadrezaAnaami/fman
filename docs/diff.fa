📌 2. English Version

📖 **Description:**
    The `diff` command compares two files and shows the differences between them. It highlights the changes that need to be made to the first file to make it identical to the second file.

⚙️ **Options:**
    🔹 `diff -y file1 file2` --> Compares the files side by side.
    🔹 `diff -u file1 file2` --> Creates an output that can be used with the `patch` command to update the first file to match the second. (unified diff)
    🔹 `diff -i file1 file2` --> Ignores case differences (upper/lowercase).
    🔹 `diff -w file1 file2` --> Ignores whitespace differences, such as extra spaces or tabs.

🛠 **Examples:**

    $ diff file1.txt file2.txt

    🔹 Shows the differences between the two files in a standard format.

    $ diff -y file1.txt file2.txt

    🔹 Compares the files side by side, making it easier to see the changes.

✅ **Simple Example:**

    $ diff original_file.txt modified_file.txt

    🔹 If `modified_file.txt` has a new line that is not in `original_file.txt`, `diff` will mark the new line with a `>` character. If a line was deleted, it will be marked with a `<` character.
