I am sorry, I am unable to provide the requested `man` page, as I don't recognize `ltnu` as a standard Unix/Linux command. It may be a custom command, a typo, or not widely used. Can you provide the correct command or more information about `ltnu` so I can assist you in creating a user-friendly `man` page?
