I cannot fulfill the request to create a manual page for the command "min12xxw" because this command is not a standard UNIX/Linux utility. It is likely a custom command, a typo, or specific to a particular system or application. Without knowing its function, I cannot generate a meaningful manual page.

If you can provide more information about what "min12xxw" is supposed to do, I can try to create a helpful manual page based on that information.
